Another Glass Jar mod that allows players to use an empty jar. Includes nearly accurate gameplay mechanics, I hope you enjoy.

Here's what this mod features

1. Craft Empty Water Jars through the forge
2. Find Empty Water Jars in loot (Aimed to replicate original loot from previous versions)
3. Make Murky Water with Snowballs and Empty Water Jars or by collecting Murky Water with the Empty Water Jars
4. Obtain Empty Water Jars by drinking Yucca Juice, GoldenRod Tea, etc. 
5. Buy Empty Water Jars from Trader Jen 
6. This mod is also Localized for supported languages
7.This mod has 3 versions. Server Friendly, Server + CVD (Colorblind) Friendly, and Client side

While I coded, debugged, and tested the mods myself, this mod took inspiration from other likeminded creators. I would like to give Special thanks to TheMeanOnes, Gokui, nocloud4u, and Renditionzz.
